# 🏗️ Project Scaffold — AI Agent Config Generator

**Generate all AI-agent config files for any full-stack project — in one go.**

A cross-platform AI agent skill that interviews you about your project, then generates a complete set of `CLAUDE.md`, rules, agents, skills, commands, progress tracking, and reference docs. Every file is self-updating, every agent asks before assuming, and the system tracks what's done, what's next, and when to stop.

## What It Does

Describe your project → the skill interviews you → generates everything:

```
.claude/
├── rules/           # code-style, testing, security, git-conventions
├── agents/          # code-reviewer, test-writer, debugger, architect
├── skills/          # new-feature, new-endpoint, new-component
└── commands/        # /new-feature, /fix-bug, /deploy-check, /status, /review
docs/agent/
├── architecture.md, database-schema.md, api-patterns.md
├── workflows.md, testing-strategy.md, deployment.md
└── progress.md      # living progress tracker
CLAUDE.md            # core memory — lean, <300 lines, self-updating
```

## The 9 Phases

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Discovery Interview** | Asks structured questions — never assumes stack or conventions |
| **2. File Generation** | Creates all config files in one batch |
| **3. Self-Updating Docs** | Every file has `<!-- UPDATE_WHEN -->` markers and changelogs |
| **4. Sub-Agents** | Code-reviewer, test-writer, debugger, architect — with tool access |
| **5. Ask-Don't-Assume** | Clarification protocol baked into every agent and CLAUDE.md |
| **6. Next Step Engine** | Suggests 2-3 prioritized next actions after every task |
| **7. Progress Tracking** | Milestones, task log, decisions, tech debt, open questions |
| **8. Best Practices & Coaching** | Contextual coaching + knows when to stop |
| **9. /status & /review** | Instant project health check and review checkpoints |

## Key Features

### 🎯 Interview First, Generate Second
The skill never assumes your stack. It asks tiered questions (Must Know → Should Know → Nice to Know) and blocks file generation until the essentials are gathered. If you've already described your project in conversation, it extracts what it can and confirms.

### 📊 Progress Tracking
A living `docs/agent/progress.md` tracks milestones customized to your project type:

| Project Type | Example Milestones |
|-------------|-------------------|
| SaaS / Dashboard | Auth, core API, user management, billing, testing, deploy |
| E-commerce | Product catalog, cart, checkout, payment, order management |
| API-only | Resource endpoints, validation, rate limiting, API docs |
| Content Platform | CMS, media upload, publishing workflow, search |
| Portfolio Site | Layout, content sections, contact form, SEO, analytics |
| Mobile Backend | Auth with device management, push notifications, real-time |

Updated after every task. Read at the start of every session.

### 💡 Best Practices Coaching
20+ contextual suggestions across Security, Performance, Quality, Reliability, and Developer Experience — each with a specific trigger condition. Maximum one per task. Always skippable.

### ✅ Completion Awareness
Three levels of "done":
- **Task-level** → Stop, confirm, offer enhancements as options (not defaults)
- **Feature-level** → Suggest review checkpoint before next feature
- **Project-level** → Launch readiness summary when all milestones are complete

Anti-overbuilding rules prevent gold-plating, premature optimization, and feature creep.

### 🔄 Self-Updating Documents
Every generated file includes:
- `<!-- UPDATE_WHEN: condition -->` markers at key decision points
- Changelog table at the bottom
- Instructions in CLAUDE.md for the agent to scan for affected docs after every task

## Usage

### Trigger Phrases

Just describe your project naturally:

> "I'm building a SaaS dashboard with Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. Generate the docs."

Or be explicit:

> "Use the project-scaffold skill to set up agent config."

Other triggers: "scaffold the project", "create the MD files", "set up Claude Code config", "generate the docs"

### After Setup

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Project health: milestones, last task, next step, tech debt |
| `/review` | Feature/milestone review checkpoint with code-reviewer agent |
| `/new-feature` | Full implementation workflow with planning and testing |
| `/fix-bug` | Structured debugging protocol |
| `/deploy-check` | Pre-deployment verification checklist |
